Task Instructions:

 Desktop Styles
These are already defined, with a container class that adds padding and an image that takes up 100% width of its container.

1. Tablet Styles:
- Modify the image size and container padding for tablet devices.
Instructions: Add media queries to adjust the img width to 80% and add some left and right padding to the `.container`. 

Optionally, you can also adjust the font size to improve readability on tablets.

2. Mobile Styles:
- Make the site mobile-friendly by tweaking the image size and padding.
Instructions: Add media queries to set the img width to 100% and reduce the padding of the `.container`
 to fit better on smaller screens. 
 
 Optionally, you can reduce the font size for better appearance on mobile devices.

Bonus: Experiment with other responsive properties like changing the font family, line height, or 
even the layout when the screen size changes.
